logeval
=======

Small Swing Tool to design and do logfile evaluations

What can be done with logeval 
-----------------------------

Using logeval a configuration-File can be created that can be used to repeatedly extract data from textual logfiles and put the extracted data into a sql-database or export it into a csv-file.
The program is ordered in multiple tabs
* **Config** allows to manage the different config files
* **LogFiles** allows to define the directory where the logfiles are which are to be evaluated
* **Extraction** in this Tab the extraction can be defined.
* **Extraction to Db** this Tab allows to control the extraction into sql-database-tables
* **Extraction to File** this Tab allows to define and control the extraction to a csv-file
